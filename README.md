COMENTS:
1. User has Login, Logout, and SignUp.
2. My email address is alyona.rodin@gmail.com to LOGIN and the password is 12345678.
3. If the users would like to sign up they have to provide their real email address. After signing up the users will receive the email that they have to confirm. After confirmation, the users have to return back and press the logout button and normally log in. It gives also the opportunity to resend the email address if suddenly someone deleted it initially to confirm it in their email.
4. The portfolio has stocks that also show the return each stock gives depending on the price it was bought initially (prices can be different). The symbol changes color red, green, grey. 
5. In stock information, the user should write the symbol to get information and it gives the information if the person can buy this stock or not, based on the cash amount left what the user also can see. It also gives the error if the stock symbol is not correct. 
6. When the user buys the stock, the user gives all information needed to buy, it sends the information to the Firebase database. It's a new thing yet for me how to use it but I feel I like it, and it gives opportunity easy to deploy the app.
7. It has two repositories [FirstOne](https://github.com/TalRodin/portfolio-stock) has 16 commits and deployed. [SecondOne](https://github.com/TalRodin/stock-portfolio) has 21 commits















This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
